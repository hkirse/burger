# Burger App

# Overview

In this assignment, we create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and an ORM.


# How the App works

There are 3 steps to the app as described below:

1.) The app is designed to have a user input any burger they want into the form located on the bottom of the page.  After clicking the submit button, the burger is then pushed to the database and input on the left side of the page.

2.) On the left side of the page, the burger is displayed with a button that allows the user to eat the burger once pushed.

3.) Once the button is pushed, the burger then moves to the right side of the page, where the burger is no longer accessible.
